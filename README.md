Years of Delicious is a fully-realized website concept for a restaurant, featuring a home page, a menu page displaying all dishes and their prices, a gallery page showcasing pictures of select dishes, a reservation page for booking tables, and a contact page for reaching out. To build this project, I chose to use Tailwind CSS for its streamlined, responsive styling capabilities.
